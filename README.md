<h1> Data Cleaning Laptops Dataset </h1>

<body>The purpose of this exercise is to use pandas to manipulate and transform exisiting information from a CSV of a range of laptops into a descriptive dataset that can be used for analysis. 
I explored the data set and columns and identified patterns and any special case. I then transformed the column information by spliting the data information and removing any non-digit characters. I converted column information into the proper dtype best used for analysis and then renamed the column if required to better describe the information. 
 
I then converted the information from the cleaned data into a new csv file for analysis.
